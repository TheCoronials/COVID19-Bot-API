## Automatic Database Setup and Data Seeding

The Creation of the in memory database as well as the seeding of test data is currently tied into the appâ€™s bootstrap code. 
This means that simply running the main python file will setup and seed the in memory database. 

## Manual Database Setup and Data Seeding

The Coronials project uses a sqlite database with the URI of 'sqlite:///coronials-collection.db'

### Creating the sqlite database

In order to create the In Memory Database you will need to run the database_setup script. Navigate to the repo directory:

```
cd repo
```

Run the database_setup script to create the database and tables from the defined models:

```
python database_setup.py
```

### Seeding the database with test data

In order to seed the database with test data, you will need to run the populate script which is also located in the repo directory:


```
python populate.py
```
