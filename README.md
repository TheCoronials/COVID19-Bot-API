## Automatic Database Setup and Data Seeding

The Creation of the in memory database as well as the seeding of test data is currently tied into the appâ€™s bootstrap code. 
This means that simply running the main python file will setup and seed the in memory database. 

## Manual Database Setup

The Coronials project uses a sqlite database with the URI of 'sqlite:///coronials-collection.db'

```

Run the database_setup script to create the database and tables from the defined models:

```
python database_setup.py
